# Contributing

## TL;DR
One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes. 
Just [follow rules used in Open Source projects on GitHub.com](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

## How to contribute
Contributions to PineBlog are welcomed in the form of constructive, reproducible bug reports, feature requests that align to the project's goals, 
or better still a PR that's accompanied with passing tests.

If you have general questions or feedback about using PineBlog, PLEASE DON'T CREATE AN ISSUE AND POST TO STACKOVERFLOW INSTEAD.

Please read the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) documentation. **TL;DR** there's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.

### Development
Check if you have the correct version of [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed, see the `global.json` for the version used.  

Node.js is also required to build and run the project, specifically the `Opw.PineBlog.RazorPages` project. You can install node.js from https://nodejs.org/, and then restart your command prompt or IDE. Make sure you also install the `npm package manager` while installing node.js.

## Bug Reports
If you're reporting a bug, please include a clear description of the issue, the version of PineBlog you're using, and a set of clear repro steps.

Please remember that PineBlog is a free and open-source project provided to the community with zero financial gain to the author(s). 
Any issues deemed to have a negative or arrogant tone will be closed without response.

## Feature Requests
If you're requesting a feature, please include a clear description of the feature.

## Pull Requests
If you've identified a feature/bug fix that aligns to the project goals, or even just an addition to the docs, please submit a Pull Request (PR). 
If applicable, include tests and ensure all tests are passing locally before you commit.

### Squash and Merge
When completing a PR you squash and merge the commits to create a more streamlined Git history in the repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they arenâ€™t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history.

The resulting squashed commit message should be a short description of what has been changed and the references to the PR and the resolved issues.
``` txt
Configurable endpoints (#9) #2 #1
```

And the resulting squashed commit message details can some more information.
``` txt
Endpoints are now configurable through `PineBlogOptions.Endpoint`
```

## Creating a new release

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Create and push a new tag with the version number, e.g. `1.2.3` ([SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)). **Do not prefix with the version number!**
3. A build will now be triggered for the release.
